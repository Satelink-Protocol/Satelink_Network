# vNext TODO (build-mode issue log)

Deferred refinements found during BUILD MODE. Logged, not acted on — building continues; the constitution/kernel are not edited to chase these.

- **M2 / kernel contract:** the kernel passes only `(cost, unit, payer, idemKey)` to `settleIn` and only `(request, supplier, {idemKey})` to `execute`; it does not thread the full quote (payTo/network/resource) or the SETTLE_IN payment proof into EXECUTE. The x402 adapter pair works around this with a shared `X402Context` keyed by txId, and the x402 settlement target is adapter-configured (from `getX402Config()`), validated against the quote. This is sufficient for single-merchant purchase. If per-transaction multi-merchant targeting is ever needed, prefer a quote-context passing convention at the adapter layer — do NOT edit `kernel.js`.
